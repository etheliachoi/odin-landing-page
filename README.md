# Description
This is an assignment for The Odin Project foundations course, Project: Landing Page. We are given two design images of a webpage and asked to recreate it using HTML and CSS. I added my own touch to it and made it into a page for my favourite game - Genshin Impact. 

## Potential fixes
The flexbox in the first section containing the main title "AR60 but exploration 15%", subtext and button below it, and the image to the right are not responding nicely when I shrink the viewport. Ideally, I would like the image to wrap to the bottom of the section but I was not able to get `flex-wrap: wrap` to work properly. 

Also, the way the image and text grow and shrink is not by using `flex: (option)`, and more hard-coded for the moment.
